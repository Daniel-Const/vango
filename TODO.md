# TODO
- Create a nicer color picker
- Add more color palettes
- Add prompt before wiping canvas (if canvas not empty)
- Refactor save image TUI stuff (nicer prompt)
- Refactor undo stack / actions

## Ideas

- Better styling: Make canvas look more like a canvas
- Brushes: Change size of stroke / Shapes?

## Bugs

- Clear uses erase once for each cell: Undo needs action list of all cells instead of 1 by 1
