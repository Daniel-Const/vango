# TODO

- Create a nicer color picker
- Add more color palettes
- Refactor brushes / brushcursor code
- Add undo/redo functionality
- Add prompt before wiping canvas (if canvas not empty)

## Ideas

- Better styling: Make canvas look more like a canvas
- Save painting to file
- Brushes: Change size of stroke / Shapes?
