# TODO

- Create a nicer color picker
- Add more color palettes
- Refactor brushes / brushcursor code 
- Refactor main View (Use {} scope to help with var names)
- Add prompt before wiping canvas (if canvas not empty)

## Ideas

- Better styling: Make canvas look more like a canvas
- Save painting to file
- Brushes: Change size of stroke?
